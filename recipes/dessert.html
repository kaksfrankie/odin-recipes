       <h1>Honey Semifreddo<em>(Frozen Italian Dessert)</em></h1>
       <img src="../images/dessert.jpg" alt="dessert" width="300" height="300">
       <p>This semifreddo recipe is even easier than the classic method, but delivers equally delicious results.</p>

       <div class="ingredients">
           <h3>Ingredients</h3>
           <ul>
               <li>8 ounces heavy cream (about 1 cup; 225g)</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
               <li>1/4 teaspoon rose water</li>
               <li>4 large eggs (about 7 ounces; 200g)</li>
               <li>4 1/2 ounces honey (about 1/3 cup; 125g)</li>
               <li>1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon (1.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight</li>
           </ul>
       </div>
       <div class="method">
           <h3>Steps</h3>
           <ol>
               <li>Step 1</li>
               <p>Line an approximately 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap or parchment, so that the bottom and sides have been covered completely (plastic is the easier liner, but will give the semifreddo a wrinkled appearance; parchment takes a little more effort, but keeps the semifreddo smooth).</p>
               <li>Step 2</li>
               <p>Next, prepare a hot water bath in a wide pot or large Dutch oven, with a thick ring of crumpled tinfoil set inside (the foil should be high enough to reach above the water level, so that it will later prevent the stand mixer bowl from touching the hot water and the bottom of the pot). If the stand mixer bowl has a metal foot, use a glass or ceramic bowl instead, in which case the foil ring is not needed.</p>
               <li>Step 3</li>
               <p>Combine the cream, vanilla, and rose water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, and whip until stiff. The time will vary depending on the power of a given mixer, so keep a close eye on the process. Transfer to separate bowl or plate, then cover and refrigerate until needed. Rinse the stand mixer bowl and whisk, then wipe dry before re-using in step 5.</p>
               <li>Step 4</li>
               <p>Combine eggs, honey, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a glass or ceramic bowl, if the stand mixer bowl has a foot). Stir with a flexible spatula to combine. Place over the prepared water bath, so that the bowl does not touch the water, and adjust heat to maintain a gentle simmer.</p>
               <li>Step 5</li>
               <p>Cook, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until warmed to 165°F, about 10 minutes in a stainless steel bowl, or about 15 if using glass or ceramic. If the process seems to be taking much longer, simply increase the heat; top the hot water bath up with more hot water if needed at any point. Once the mixture reaches 165°F, transfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip on high speed until eggs are foamy, more than quadrupled in size, and thick enough to briefly mound up like soft-serve ice cream when dropped from the whisk, between 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the mixer's power. The bowl itself should also feel cool to the touch.</p>
